/*
Package lookup implements a nice, simple and fast library which helps you to lookup
objects on a screen. It also includes OCR functionality. With Lookup you can do
OCR tricks like recognizing any information in a screenshot from your Robot
application. Which can be useful for debugging or automating things.

This library is a straight port of the Java LookUp library (https://github.com/iamshajeer/lookup)
to GoLang. Details on NCC (Normalized Cross Correlation) used by this library can be found in the original
library's docs folder (a lot of math).
